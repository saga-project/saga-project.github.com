   <h2>What is SAGA</h2>

   <p>SAGA is a standardized API for developing distributed applications that
   can run on grid and cloud infrastructure. The SAGA API has an emphasis on
   job handling and monitoring, file transfer and management as well as
   distributed orchestration mechanisms. The main goals of SAGA are:</p>

   <ul>

     <li> Provide a uniform access-layer to heterogeneous distributed computing
     infrastructures and middleware

     <li> Provide a stable programming interface for distributed applications,
     frameworks and tool development

     <li> Lower the application deployment barrier on production
     Cyber-Infrastructure

     <li> Provide the building blocks to enable the design and implementation
     of higher-level abstractions in support of distributed application
     requirements

   </ul>

   <p>The aim of the SAGA Project is to guide and influence the evolution of the
   standard and open source SAGA implementations and to promote SAGA as an
   abstraction layer in the global distributed computing community.  TheProject
   is associated with the  <a href= "http://radical.rutgers.edu">RADICAL Group</a> 
   at the <a href= "http://nsfcac.rutgers.edu/">Cloud and Autonomic Computing Center</a> 
   at Rutgers University.  </p>
